## Description
This application is a book search engine that allows users to search for books and save them to their profile. This application was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

The application was originally built with a RESTful API, but was refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
